# Changelog

## v0.30.0

Adds:

- Word Count in the status bar. Thanks too [@SjoerdHekking](https://github.com/SjoerdHekking) for the contribution ([PR #165](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/165)).

Changes:

- Fixes incorrect comment block highlighting for SugarCube style markup syntax ([Issue #169](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/169)).

## v0.29.0

Adds:

- `<<silent>>` macro snippets for SugarCube-2 ([Issue #167](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/167)).

Changes:

- Fixes `<<createplaylist>>` macro snippet ([Issue #168](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/168)).

## v0.28.0

Adds:

- Syntax highlighting for Chapbook-2. Thanks to [@sgranade](https://github.com/sgranade) for the contribution ([PR #166](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/166)).

## v0.27.7

Changes:

- Reverts change done in v0.27.5, as the root cause for the infinite triggers was fixed in v0.27.6.

## v0.27.6

Changes:

- Fixes handling of asynchronous startup sequence, eliminating cases where language for documents are not set by the time the startup sequence ends.

## v0.27.5

Changes:

- `onDidOpenTextDocument` handler no longer tries to change the language of the document, potentially fixing [Issue #162](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/162). Changing the language of a text document triggers the `onDidOpenTextDocument` event. In projects with a large number of files, despite there being a check for whether the language of the document is already set to the target, the event can trigger before the language is actually set. This causes the event and language change function to be called one after the other ad infinitum. 

## v0.27.4

Changes:

- Glob matcher now returns absolute paths instead of relative paths to files in workspace. Fixing [Issue #163](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/163).

## v0.27.3

Adds:

- Extension process logging under "T3LT (Log)".
- Error handling for file opening during startup which caused it never resolve and move on with further startup functions leading to infinite loading and broken features [Issue #163](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/163).

## v0.27.0

Adds:

- Debouncing for passage text parsing and diagnostic updates in the `onDidChangeTextDocument` handler. Should hopefully reduce CPU usage when making large edits.
- `twee3LanguageTools.parseText.wait` and `twee3LanguageTools.parseText.maxWait`: Configurations to modify the debounce wait durations.

Changes:

- Diagnostics updater doesn't comb through a document line-by-line anymore. Since that is already done by passage text parsers, results from that are leveraged instead. Should hopefully reduce CPU usage for larger projects.

Updates:

- Engine to Node 20
- Most dependencies have been updated to latest versions

## v0.25.0

Adds:

- Basic definition support for SugarCube 2 macros and widgets (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Click</kbd> to go to definition) - [PR #150](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/150).

## v0.24.0

## v0.23.0

Adds:

## v0.22.0

Adds:

- `OnEnterRules` for SugarCube-2, handling indentation for macros. Partially addresses [Issue #144](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/144).

## v0.21.0

Adds:

- Enums to SugarCube macro definitions ([Issue #139](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/139) and [PR #141](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/141)).  
- Setting to customize number of aliases allowed in a single yaml file ([PR #142](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/142)).

Fixes:

- Performance improvements for large projects ([PR #140](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/140)).  
- SugarCube macro definition handling ([PR #143](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/143)).

## v0.20.0

Adds:

- Editor context menu item: `Set passage as story start` sets the currently focused passage in the editor as the start passage. 

## v0.19.4

- Premature closing of the storymap when in webview mode ([Comment on #103](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/103#issuecomment-1144213162)).
- Sanitizes tags when added from the story map. Resolves [Issue #115](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/115).
- Fixes saving of changes to tags array from story map.

## v0.18.0

Adds:

- Symbol provider for passages. Resolves [Issue #106](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/106).

## v0.17.1

- Webview Story Map now auto opens to a side in a locked editor group. Resolves [Issue #103](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/103).

## v0.17.0

- Webview version of Story Map, which is now the default mode. Change using the `twee3LanguageTools.storyMap.windowType` setting.

## v0.16.3

Merges [PR #96](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/96).

## v0.16.2

Merges [PR #94](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/94).

## v0.16.1

Merges [PR #93](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/93).

## v0.16.0

Adds:

- Focus current passage in the Story Map ([PR #92](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/92).) It is both available from right-click context menu in the editor, as well as from the command palette as `Focus passage in Story Map`.

## v0.15.4

Merges [PR #91](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/91).

## v0.15.3

Adds:

- ([PR #86](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/86)) SugarCube 2: Basic max check for validating children macros such as else. (Resolving [Issue #85](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/issues/85).)

Fixes:

- SugarCube 2: Background color of matched macro opening/closing tags was the same as that of editor selections, make it impossible to see how much of the text was actually selected. Removed background color so it works like other text.

## v0.15.2

Adds:

- A [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md) for working with Twee ([PR #78](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/78)).  
- SugarCube 2: A command to add all unrecognized macros in the current file. Helpful in large projects, where adding all at once is rather slow, or you only care about the current file ([PR #82](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/82)).

Fixes ([PR #82](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/82)):

- `updateDecorations` code which wasn't guarding against undefined properly, so it'd spit out errors.  
- Improves the existing 'add all unrecognized macros' command to have a progress bar which informs the user of what it is doing, and allows cancelling it if it is taking too long. Especially helpful in large projects where that might take a while.

## v0.15.0

Adds:

- Receiver parameter type for SugarCube 2 macro parameter validation. [PR #64](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/64)  
- <kbd>Ctrl + I</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl + B</kbd> keybindings for italics and bold in SugarCube 2 and Harlowe projects. [PR #66](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/66)
- Custom decoration declarations for SugarCube 2 macros. [PR #67](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/twee3-language-tools/pull/67)

Fixes:

- Parameter documentation improvements.

	![move-to-file](docs/images/twee-storymap-move2file.png)

## v0.10.1

	- Deprecated `<<end...>>` SC macros can be converted to the `<</...>>` form.
	- Unrecognized macros can now be defined and added to a local file (`t3lt.twee-config.yml`) with a quick fix. If the macro has been closed anywhere within the source file, the extension assumes the macro is a container and sets that property to `true`.

	- Container macros now have decorators for their closing tag. See [Readme](README.md#sugarcube) for more details.

## v0.3.3

Removes:

- Parsing of JSDoc comments to provide code suggestions. This was causing basic plaintext suggestions to stop working, and is a limitation of the code completion features VSCode facilitates. Going forward, suggestions will be left to code snippets defined in JSON files.

## v0.3.0

Adds:

- A new tree view container in the activity bar. Currently, it shows a list of passages across all Twee files in the workspace, along with links to jump to them. See [Readme](README.md#features) for screencaps.

Fixes:

- > ~~If JSDoc comments containing widget/macro documentations are removed, older definitions still stay in memory, and cause the editor to provide suggestions for macros that are no longer documented. To fix, restart VSCode, or reload the window (type "Reload Window" into the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P</kbd> by default)).~~
